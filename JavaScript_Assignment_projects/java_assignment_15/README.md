2. **movie.html**: The main HTML file for the webpage.
3. **movie.js**: JavaScript file that handles fetching, displaying, and searching movies.
4. **README.md**: Instructions and details about the program.

## Usage
1. Open `movie.html` in a web browser.
2. The list of movies will be displayed automatically.
3. Use the search bar to find a movie by its title.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- The `movies.json` file must be in the same directory as the HTML file.

## Example

2. Type part or all of a movie title (e.g., "Godfather") in the search bar and click **Search**. Only matching movies will be displayed.
